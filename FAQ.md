## Getting Started

### Q: I'm completely new to Linux. Where should I start?

**A:** Start with [Part 1: Getting Started](./docs/01-getting-started.md). Don't try to learn everything at once. Follow this path:

1. **Week 1:** Basic navigation (pwd, cd, ls)
2. **Week 2:** File operations (touch, cp, mv, rm)
3. **Week 3:** Text viewing (cat, less, grep)
4. **Week 4:** Permissions basics (chmod, chown)

Practice 15-30 minutes daily. It's better than 3-hour weekend sessions.

---

### Q: Do I need to install Linux to learn?

**A:** No! You have several options:

**Without Installing:**

- **Windows:** Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- **Mac:** Built-in terminal (very similar)
- **Online:** Try [https://www.katacoda.com](https://www.katacoda.com)
- **Browser:** Use [https://bellard.org/jslinux/](https://bellard.org/jslinux/)

**Installing (Recommended):**

- **VirtualBox** - Free VM software
- **Dual Boot** - Run alongside Windows
- **Live USB** - Try without installing

---

### Q: Which Linux distribution should I use?

**A:** For learning, these are best:

**Top Recommendations:**

1. **Ubuntu** - Most beginner-friendly, huge community
2. **Linux Mint** - Like Ubuntu but simpler
3. **Fedora** - Modern, great for developers
4. **Pop!\_OS** - Ubuntu-based, excellent out-of-box

**For this guide:** All commands work on any distribution. Minor differences noted where relevant.

---

### Q: How long does it take to learn Linux?

**A:** It depends on your goals:

- **Basic competency:** 4-8 weeks (30 min/day)
- **Intermediate skills:** 3-6 months
- **Advanced proficiency:** 1-2 years
- **Master level:** Continuous learning

**Remember:** You don't need to know everything. Focus on what you need.

---

### Q: Is Linux hard to learn?

**A:** Not if you approach it correctly:

**Common Misconceptions:**

- ❌ "You need to be a programmer"
- ❌ "It's only for hackers"
- ❌ "Everything is command-line"
- ❌ "You need to memorize commands"

**Reality:**

- ✅ Anyone can learn Linux
- ✅ Start with basics, progress gradually
- ✅ Modern Linux has GUIs too
- ✅ Understanding > Memorization

---

## Learning & Practice

### Q: How should I practice?

**A:** Follow the 70-20-10 rule:

- **70%** - Hands-on practice (try commands)
- **20%** - Learning (reading this guide)
- **10%** - Teaching (explain to others/write notes)

**Practice ideas:**

- Complete exercises in each section
- Build a personal project
- Help friends with Linux issues
- Contribute to open-source

---

### Q: I keep forgetting commands. Is that normal?

**A:** Absolutely normal! Nobody memorizes everything.

**Solutions:**

- Use `history` to see previous commands
- Create aliases for common tasks
- Keep a personal cheat sheet
- Use `man` pages and `--help`
- Practice the same commands repeatedly

**Pro tip:** Focus on understanding concepts, not memorizing syntax.

---

### Q: Where can I practice safely?

**A:** Use these safe environments:

**Virtual Machines:**

- VirtualBox (free)
- VMware Player (free)
- QEMU (free)

**Containers:**

- Docker
- LXC/LXD

**Cloud:**

- AWS Free Tier
- Google Cloud Free Trial
- DigitalOcean (cheap droplets)

**Never:**

- Practice destructive commands on production systems
- Test without backups
- Run unknown scripts as root

---

### Q: What if I break something?

**A:** In a learning environment:

1. **Don't panic** - It's just a VM/container
2. **Learn from it** - What went wrong?
3. **Start fresh** - Rebuild and try again
4. **Document it** - Write what you learned

**In production:**

- Always have backups
- Test in development first
- Use version control
- Document changes

---

## Commands & Usage

### Q: Why do some commands have different outputs on my system?

**A:** Several reasons:

1. **Different distributions** - Ubuntu vs CentOS
2. **Different versions** - Older vs newer
3. **System configuration** - Custom setups
4. **Aliases** - Custom command shortcuts
5. **Locale settings** - Language/region

**Check:** Your distribution and version:

```bash
lsb_release -a
uname -a
```

---

### Q: What's the difference between `sudo` and `su`?

**A:**

**`sudo`** (recommended):

- Runs ONE command as root
- Requires your password
- Logged for auditing
- Temporary elevated privileges

```bash
sudo apt install package
```

**`su`** (switch user):

- Switches to root user completely
- Requires root password
- Stays root until you exit
- More dangerous

```bash
su
# Now you're root until you type 'exit'
```

**Best practice:** Use `sudo` for individual commands.

---

### Q: When should I use `sudo rm -rf`?

**A:** ⚠️ **EXTREMELY RARELY!**

This is one of the most dangerous commands. It:

- Deletes everything recursively
- Forces deletion (no confirmation)
- Cannot be undone

**Only use when:**

- You're ABSOLUTELY sure
- You've verified the path multiple times
- You have backups
- You understand the consequences

**Never run:**

```bash
sudo rm -rf /    # Deletes EVERYTHING
sudo rm -rf /*   # Same thing
```

---

### Q: What's the difference between absolute and relative paths?

**A:**

**Absolute path** - From root (`/`):

```bash
/home/user/documents/file.txt
```

Always starts with `/`. Works from anywhere.

**Relative path** - From current location:

```bash
documents/file.txt    # If you're in /home/user
./documents/file.txt  # Same thing
../user2/file.txt     # Go up, then into user2
```

Use `pwd` to see where you are.

---

### Q: Why do commands sometimes start with `.` or `./`?

**A:**

**`.`** (single dot) = current directory

**`./`** before a file = run it from current directory

Example:

```bash
./script.sh  # Run script.sh from current directory
```

Why needed? Linux doesn't run programs from current directory by default (security feature).

---

## Permissions & Security

### Q: What does "Permission denied" mean?

**A:** You don't have the right permissions.

**Solutions:**

**For reading files:**

```bash
# Try with sudo
sudo cat /protected/file

# Or get permission from owner
```

**For executing scripts:**

```bash
# Add execute permission
chmod +x script.sh
```

**For system operations:**

```bash
# Use sudo
sudo systemctl restart service
```

---

### Q: How do I make a file executable?

**A:**

```bash
chmod +x filename.sh
```

Then run it:

```bash
./filename.sh
```

---

### Q: What are file permissions numbers (755, 644, etc.)?

**A:** Each digit represents permissions for:

1. Owner
2. Group
3. Others

**Numbers mean:**

- 7 = rwx (read + write + execute)
- 6 = rw- (read + write)
- 5 = r-x (read + execute)
- 4 = r-- (read only)

**Common patterns:**

- **755** - Standard executable (rwxr-xr-x)
- **644** - Standard file (rw-r--r--)
- **600** - Private file (rw-------)
- **777** - Everything (avoid this!)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Q: My terminal shows strange characters. What happened?

**A:** You probably viewed a binary file.

**Fix:**

```bash
reset
```

Or close and reopen terminal.

---

### Q: I accidentally deleted important files. Can I recover them?

**A:** Maybe, but it's difficult.

**Immediate steps:**

1. **Stop using the disk** - Don't write anything
2. **Don't restart**
3. **Use recovery tools:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install testdisk photorec
   ```

**Prevention:**

- Regular backups
- Use trash instead of `rm`
- Alias `rm` to `rm -i` (asks confirmation)

---

### Q: My system is slow. How do I find out why?

**A:** Use these commands:

```bash
# Check CPU usage
top

# Check memory
free -h

# Check disk space
df -h

# Check disk I/O
iostat

# Check specific process
ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head
```

See [Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/troubleshooting.md) for detailed solutions.

---

### Q: How do I stop a command that's taking too long?

**A:**

- **Ctrl+C** - Stop current command
- **Ctrl+Z** - Suspend command
- **Ctrl+D** - End input (exit)

If terminal is completely frozen:

- Open new terminal
- Find process: `ps aux | grep command`
- Kill it: `kill PID` or `kill -9 PID`
